## üßµ Common Problems in Population-Scale Genomic Analysis

This document outlines frequent challenges encountered in population-level genomic studies, along with appropriate statistical tools and software packages to address them. These are relevant for both hypothesis-driven and discovery-based projects.

### ‚ùì **Problem 1: I want to find a gene or pathway likely causing a disease**

**Context**: You have a phenotype but no clear SNPs, or SNPs scattered across genes. You want to implicate genes or biological pathways.

**Approaches**:

* Gene-level aggregation of SNPs, maybe first GWAS and fine-mapping approahces, then aggregated to gene-level
* Pathway enrichment on top genes
* Functional overlap with known disease databases

**Statistical Tools**:

* `MAGMA`, `SKAT`, `VEGAS2`
* `gseapy`, `fgsea`, `ReactomePA`
* `OpenTargets`, `DisGeNET`, `Enrichr`

### ‚ùì **Problem 2: How do I predict which individuals in a clinical trial will respond to treatment?**

**Context**: You‚Äôre designing a precision medicine strategy. Predict high-responders and low-responders. It may also be that you want to detect patients likely to have rare side-effects, if they for example cannot metabolise the drug properly. For example limited data from phase 1 and 2 can be used to predict phase 3, using the same companion diagnostic.

**Approaches**:

* SNP-by-treatment interaction models
* ML-based classifiers using SNPs, PRS, or gene expression

**Statistical Tools**:

* `glm(interaction terms)` in R or `statsmodels`
* `XGBoost`, `LightGBM` with SHAP values
* `scikit-learn`, `catboost`, `mlxtend`

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 3: Can I reposition a drug from one disease to another using shared genetic architecture?**

**Context**: You want to explore drug repurposing by linking genetic mechanisms across diseases. 

**Approaches**:

* Shared pathway analysis between GWAS hits
* Gene overlap between diseases
* Network-based proximity of disease genes to drug targets
See my drugsXdisease package

**Statistical Tools**:

* `MAGMA`, `coloc`, `LD Hub`
* `OpenTargets`, `DrugBank`, `DisGeNET`
* Graph/network tools: `NetworkX`, `igraph`, `Hetionet`, `GSEA`

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 4: How can I discover different genetic subtypes within one phenotypic disease?**

**Context**: A phenotype (e.g., diabetes, autism, cancer) may actually include several genetically distinct subtypes that present similarly. Maybe wgs or exprression data exists, together with clinical data, which allows for in-depth exploration of disease drivers. 

**Approaches**:

* **Unsupervised clustering** on genotype data to identify subpopulations, followed by grouping/enrichment
* **Latent class analysis (LCA)** or **topic modeling** using phenotypes and genotypes jointly

**Statistical Tools**:

* PCA / UMAP / t-SNE for dimensionality reduction (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `umap-learn`)
* Clustering algorithms: KMeans, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN
* Admixture tools: `ADMIXTURE`, `fastSTRUCTURE`
* Joint modeling: `MOFA2`, `LatentDirichletAllocation` in `sklearn`

### ‚ùì **Problem 5: I have several unrelated families with rare disease; how do I test if the same gene is involved?**

**Context**: You suspect a rare disease has multiple genetic origins that converge on the same gene or pathway.

**Approaches**:

* **Gene-based burden tests** (collapsing rare variants in a gene)
* **Variant sharing analysis** across families

**Statistical Tools**:

* `SKAT` / `SKAT-O` (R package)
* `seqMeta`, `rareMETALS` (meta-analysis)
* `PyRare` (Python-based burden testing)
* Custom IBD analysis using `plink --genome`, `IBDseq`

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 6: How do I calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS)?**

**Context**: You want to predict individual risk for a trait based on many SNPs, each with small effect sizes.

**Approaches**:

* Weighted sum of effect alleles using GWAS summary statistics
* Adjust for LD using Bayesian shrinkage
* Be careful that the many low-effect variants in the PRS scores actually make sense, and are biologically plausible, for more accurate results

**Statistical Tools**:

* `PRSice-2` (best for quick setup)
* `LDpred2` (R, LD-aware, very robust)
* `plink2` with score files
* `scikit-PRS` (experimental Python version)

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 7: I want to fine-map my GWAS hits to identify causal SNPs**

**Context**: You‚Äôve identified a locus with several significant SNPs. You want to find which one is causal.

**Approaches**:

* Bayesian variable selection / credible sets
* Integration with functional annotation

**Statistical Tools**:

* `SuSiE` (R package, works well with LD blocks)
* `FINEMAP`, `CAVIAR`, `PAINTOR`
* `rpy2` for Python‚ÄìR bridging to call `susieR`

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 8: My population is structured (e.g., has ancestry subgroups). How do I correct for this?**

**Context**: Population stratification can cause spurious associations in GWAS or PheWAS.

**Approaches**:

* Correct for top PCs as covariates
* Use linear mixed models to account for relatedness

**Statistical Tools**:

* `plink` or `smartpca` for PCA
* `LMMs`: `GEMMA`, `BOLT-LMM`, `SAIGE`
* `fastGWA` (UK Biobank-scale tools)

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 9: How do I detect regions under selection in a population?**

**Context**: You‚Äôre studying adaptation or population differentiation.

**Approaches**:

* Between-group: **Fst**, **PBS**
* Within-group: **iHS**, **nSL**, **ROH**

**Statistical Tools**:

* `scikit-allel` (Python)
* `selscan`, `hapbin`, `rehh` (R)
* `plink` for ROH/IBD

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 10: How do I interpret my GWAS biologically?**

**Context**: You have a list of significant SNPs but want to find enriched pathways, gene functions, etc.

**Approaches**:

* Gene and pathway enrichment analysis
* Cross-reference with expression (e.g., GTEx)

**Statistical Tools**:

* `MAGMA` for gene-level and pathway testing
* `DEPICT`, `FUMA`, `GSEA` (with `gseapy` or `fgsea`)
* `coloc` for eQTL colocalization

---

### ‚ùì **Problem 11: I want to match cases and controls by genetic ancestry**

**Context**: You have imbalanced or admixed populations and want to avoid bias.

**Approaches**:

* Match on genetic PCs or clustering labels
* Propensity score matching (genotype-derived)

**Statistical Tools**:

* PCA via `plink` or `scikit-learn`
* `matchit` (R), `pymatch`, or `propensity-score-matching` in Python
* Custom PCA matching (e.g., `pca_matching.py` in your toolkit)
